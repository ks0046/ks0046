# Hi, I'm Kriti Samnotra

MS Public Policy & Management (DC Track) at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. I work at the intersection of policy analysis and technology: focused on energy, tech infrastructure, and digital governance.

Before grad school, I spent 2.5 years at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Mumbai working on environmental and social impact assessments for renewable energy projects across India, and policy research at a New Delhi think tank delivering strategic recommendations to Indian ministries and international organizations.

As AI reshapes how governments operate and deliver services, I use this space to build tools that make policy information more accessible, help governments hear what communities need, and deepen my own understanding of how AI can improve public service delivery.
